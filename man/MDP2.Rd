\section{To do}{


Nested loading in memory (specify a HMDP with special actions containing child + father jump actions)
Idea when define the proc with an external nested process use
w$includeProcess(prefix, transPr, index) (specify the child jump action)
w$stage()
w$state()
w$action(...) (specify father jump action scope must be zeor)
w$action(...) (specify father jump action scope must be zeor)
w$endState()
w$endStage()
w$endIncludeProcess()

The hgf then is formed with a subprocess mimic the 1. and last stage of the external proc, i.e. we include the jump pr in the hgf
We need a new binary file "externalProcess.bin" for storing the nested process in the format "n0 s0 a0 n1 s1 prefix -1 ..." which specify which stage contain the states corresponding to the 1. stage of the nested process (it is here the nested hfg must be loaded and calculated
